This system allows users to carry out major pre-processing tasks with ease and simplicity. Users
can upload a CSV file, and perform common pre-processing tasks i.e. Tokenization, Lemmatization
and Stopword Removal and further view and download the processed dataset within minutes. The
system emphasises efficiency, simpleness and effectiveness in pre-processing, which is a crucial
stage in handling data, training and testing models, data analysis, etc.

Figures showcase the Home Page, designed to provide users with information
about the pre-processing tasks involved in the subsequent page, namely the Data Preprocessor page. The Home Page offers an overview of the functionalities available, and the
"Begin" button serves as a prompt to redirect users to the next page, where they can initiate
the pre-processing tasks.
The upload section is depicted, allowing users to upload datasets in CSV
format for pre-processing. Only CSV files are accepted in this section, ensuring
compatibility with the pre-processing framework. Users can select the desired CSV file
containing the dataset that requires pre-processing, enabling seamless integration of
external data into the framework for analysis and manipulation.
The task selection interface, where users can choose specific preprocessing tasks to execute on the uploaded dataset. Upon selecting a task, the framework
executes it, and a notification displaying "Tasks ran successfully" appears, providing users
with real-time feedback on task execution progress.
The preview section is depicted, enabling users to visualize the preprocessed dataset before downloading it in CSV format. This feature allows users to verify
the effectiveness of the pre-processing tasks and make any necessary adjustments before
finalizing the dataset
